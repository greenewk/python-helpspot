Python HelpSpot API
-------------------

A Python module for talking to [HelpSpot](http://www.userscape.com/products/helpspot/) via its [Web Services API](https://support.helpspot.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=28).

For usage, see the docstring in the helpspot/api.py file.

Design Note
-----------

I wanted this to be lightweight and dynamic so I chose to define as little as possible about the actual HelpSpot API
in this module. It is up to you to figure out what arguments to send to HelpSpot and how to decode its responses.

I welcome your feedback.
